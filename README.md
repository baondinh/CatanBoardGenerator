# CatanBoardGenerator
Board state generator for popular board game Settlers of Catan
Currently working on a way to identify nodes and calculate "high-value" nodes
- Able to identify three way intersections
- Need to implement a way to rank ports
- Need a way to evaluate path distance to other "high-value" nodes
