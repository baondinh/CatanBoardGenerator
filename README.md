# ðŸŒ„ Settlers of Catan Board Generator and Visualizer (Python + Tkinter)

This project generates and visualizes a randomized Settlers of Catan board using Python and the tkinter library. It follows OOP principles to add layers of abstraction and uses the tkinter GUI toolkit to create an interactive visualization for the user. At a glance, the code includes logic for hexagonal tile generation, the board layout, tile coloring, number placement, adjacency mapping, and shared vertex calculations.

### Features:
- Hexagonal Tile Generation: Individual tile objects hold information used for board generation. Adjacency and vertex-tile center logic used to compute coordinates of hexagonal tiles.
- Randomized Tile Colors: Tiles are randomly assigned colors (representing resource types from Settlers of Catan) from a predefined distribution of each resource type.
- Dice Number Assignment: Numbers (2â€“12, excluding 7) are randomly distributed among resource tiles. Every number except 2 and 12 (and 7) are shown twice. 
- Adjacency Mapping: Efficiently computes which tiles are adjacent to each other based on tile center-to-center distance.
- Vertex Sharing Logic: Identifies shared vertices between tiles using floating-point coordinate comparisons with a strict tolerance.
- Vertex Probability Sums: Calculates the summed dice roll probabilities for three-way tile intersections â€” useful for strategy analysis.
- GUI: Draws the full board using tkinter.

### Object-Oriented Design:
`CatanTile` Class encapsulates the logic for an individual hex tile:
- Calculates the six vertex positions of a regular hexagon relative to its center.
- Stores color, name, number, and vertex coordinate information.
- Includes other methods for drawing itself and detecting adjacency with other tiles.

`CatanBoard` Class encapsulates logic that manages the entire game board:
- Generates a fixed-size hexagonal grid layout centered on a given coordinate.
  - Initially planned to have "spiraling outward" sequential generation from a single central coordinate, but geometrical ratios to keep fixed regular hexagons became too complicated
  - Currently generates by column
- Populates tile colors and dice values.
- Computes adjacency maps and shared vertex intersections.
- Provides drawing and refresh functionality in the GUI.

### Shared Vertex Calculation:
- Math related issues were common in this project
- Due to floating-point rounding issues, shared vertices between adjacent tiles are identified by comparing coordinate pairs within a tolerance of 0.001.
- A match is declared if both the X and Y coordinate differences fall within this margin.
- This is not the most efficient way to determine shared vertices as it indicates an underlying imperfection in tile generation (shared vertices should be exact)

### More on Tile Layout Logic:
Tile generation is completed by column starting with a central column of tiles and symmetrical surrounding columns. Tiles are positioned based on:
- Vertical spacing: Calculated using the height of a hexagon $\sqrt{3} \cdot \text{side length}$ 
- Horizontal offsets: Based on the row distance from center and the column length $\frac{3}{2} \cdot \text{side length}$
- Total of 19 hexes generated to match Catan board
  
### Work in Progress:
- Identify three-way intersections and use associated number values of the three tiles to determine "hotspots"
  - Requires more probability and statistical analysis with random variables
- Need to implement a way to evaluate port value
  - These are either on a single tile vertex or a shared vertex between two tiles maximum
- Need a way to evaluate path distance to other "high-value" nodes
  - "Longest road" ease of completion/maintenance
  - Shortest path to specific resources
  - Shortest path to ports
  - Efficiency of new settlement creation (requires two edges between each city)
